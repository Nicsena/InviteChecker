# InviteChecker

One thing: use at your own risk, and i'm not responsible for anything that happens.

## Install
Open up console and type `npm install`<br>
Then run `node index.js` or `nodemon index.js` if you have nodemon installed.
<br><br>
Once a discord invite code is found, the server name and invite url will be added to the invites.json file
